# LTVV-variation-by-hospital
A use case of CLIF reliably pair data from different hospitals across the United States at the hour level. In this study, we sought to utilize this framework to demonstrate the use-case of evaluating evaluating hospital variation of low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) settings, an evidence-based practice in those needing mechanical ventilation.
